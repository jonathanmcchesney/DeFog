## Cloud & Edge Based server deployments

I decided to take iPokeMon and Xonotic through to the next stage, cloud and edge server deployments:

iPokeMon AWS cloud server EC2 instance:
```
54.229.126.87
```

Xonotic AWS cloud EC2 sever instance:
```
34.243.205.166
```

## Apache JMeter

I am using Apache JMeter to test requests to the iPokeMon cloud server, as I do not have a MAC OS device to compile the client.

## Repositories used
